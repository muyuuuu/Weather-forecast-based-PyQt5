# Intro

Practical application of a basic widgets.

`weather.py` is the same as `weather1.py`, except that `weather1.py` adds split window technology, which automatically drags the sub-window size.

`python weather1.py` can run it.

`最新_city.json` gives the code of the city.

`read_citycode.py` returns a city code correspondingly.

`get_weather.py` requests weather by city code.
